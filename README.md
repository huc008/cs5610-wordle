## What is this
This is a web word-guessing game inspired by the [wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) developed by Josh Wardle. This game is improved by adding different modes to have more fun.We created this because we love this game but the once a day limit leaves me wanting more.

Enjoy!

## How to play

Guess the magic WORDLE in several tries (7-easy, 6-medium, 5-hard).

You can guess any valid word of the length of columns. Hit the enter button to submit.

After each guess, each letter spot will turn green, yellow, or gray to give you some hints:

Green = Correct letter, correct spot
Yellow = Correct letter, wrong spot
Gray = Wrong spot

## Developing features
- If given more time, I would like to add a new feature which can calculate how much score the user get from different level of difficulty games. If the user successfully guessed a easy level game, he will win 5 points, medium level: 6 points, and hard level: 7 points. Once the user gets to 50 points, he will get a magic sentence as the prize. 
- What's more, I also would like to design the page to be more mobile screen friendly.
