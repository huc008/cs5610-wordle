- What were some challenges you faced while making this app?

The challenges were at first we were not sure which functions and hooks we should share among    
different components and which functions are local.
And the save data features produced some bugs that were not easy to fix for us. 

- Given more time, what additional features, functional or design changes would you make?
I would like to add a new feature which can calculate how much score the user get from differnt 
level of difficulty games. If the user successfully guessed a easy level game, he will win 5 points,
medium level: 6 points, and hard level: 7 points. Once the user gets to 50 points, he will 
get a magic sentence as the prize. 

- What assumptions did you make while working on this assignment?
The assumptions I made for this assignment were that since the game is complicated, 
and and in each page there were some common features such as keyboard, I should consider what components 
could be reused and what cannot be reused, so that my code would be efficient and redable. 

- How long did this assignment take to complete?
10 days.
